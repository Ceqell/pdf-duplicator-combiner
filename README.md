It works offlineish. It does use cdn links for it's libraries so you'll need to load the page at least once with an internet connection. If you don't like that download the .js libraries yourself and point the html files to the libraries yourself.

Remember to provide attribution and I'll be happy. Or not if you're using this for like personal use.
