# pdf-duplicator

Simple .pdf file page duplicator. No data is ever uploaded and is processed locally on device.

How it works: [View Discussion](https://github.com/Ceqell/pdf-duplicator/discussions/1) [^disclaimer] [^2] [^3]

[^disclaimer]: This tool is designed for offline use but relies on external CDNs (Tailwind, Lucide, pdf-lib) for core functionality. 
[^2]: Important: You must load the tool once while online to allow your browser to cache these libraries. Note that clearing your browser cache or using "Incognito" mode will remove these files. For 100% offline reliability, download the .js files and update the <script> tags to point to your local copies.
[^3]: If you want the fully offline version, consider using the mostly stable and polished BETA version: https://ceqell.github.io/pdf-duplicator/beta/
